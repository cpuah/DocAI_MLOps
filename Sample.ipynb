    "# Azure Document Intelligence Custom Template User Feedback Loop Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement a simple way to enable a user to draw over a document that may have been processed by Azure AI Document Intelligence to provide feedback on the quality of results by highlighting incorrect or missing information with corrections. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to showcase how a feedback mechanism can be implemented to allow the developers of custom models in Azure AI Document Intelligence to collect feedback from users to improve the model with the ability to retrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: This notebook only showcases the potential user interaction. The outputs are created as the labels JSON schema used by the Azure AI Document Intelligence service. The actual feedback processing and retraining of the model is not implemented in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook uses [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to ensure that all the required dependencies are available in a consistent local development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are required to run this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n",
    "- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)\n",
    "- [Remote - Containers extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: The notebook is designed to run in a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) in Visual Studio Code. The Dev Container is pre-configured with the required dependencies and extensions. You can run this notebook outside of a Dev Container, but you will need to manually install the required dependencies including Poppler, Tesseract, and OpenCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dev Container will include the following dependencies by default:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Debian 11 (Bullseye) base image\n",
    "- Python 3.12\n",
    "  - ipycanvas - for rendering the document and allowing the user to draw over it\n",
    "  - ipykernel - for running the notebook\n",
    "  - notebook - for running the notebook\n",
    "  - opencv-python-headless - for image processing\n",
    "  - pdf2image - for converting PDFs to images\n",
    "  - pytesseract - for performing OCR on the document\n",
    "- Poppler - used by pdf2image to convert PDFs to images\n",
    "- Tesseract OCR - used by pytesseract to perform OCR on the document\n",
    "- Python3 OpenCV - used for image processing"
